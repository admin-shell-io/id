# Template

This document serves as a template for your identifiers. Copy it into your desired subnamespace folder, and replace the sections accordingly. The more detailled information you can provide, the faster your request can be processed. Please note that all explanations have to be in English only.

## Introduction

Give some information on the background of the subnamespace. Explain why it is relevant for Industry 4.0 and what you want to accomplish.


## Identifier 1 (ShortId)

Add the ShortId in the headline. We recommend using [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) Notation. Properties, attributes or in general any SubmodelElements start with a lower case, while classes or named entities have a capital first letter. Please arrange the words alphabetically, so start with 'a' and end with 'z'. No numbers or special characters are allowed at the first position.

[https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/version/revision](https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/version/revision) (Add the complete URI of your identifier here. Start with the latest version and revision.) Description: explain what your identifier means and why it is necessary. Give as much information as possiblebut not much more than one paragraph each.


[https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/oldVersion/oldRevision](https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/oldVersion/oldRevision) (list all old versions/revisions under the currently valid one.) Description: Explain their meaning and add at least one sentence why you needed to deprecate the identifier.
