# AAS

Sub-namespace for the AAS Metamodel. The Metamodel is defined in a series of
publications, the ``Details of the Asset Administration Shell'', composed of
three parts:
* Part 1 contains the core classes and attributes, and a set of standardized
serializations.
* Part 2 defines the APIs as well as the  access and manipulation methods with
AAS components

As of April 2022, two major versions of Part 1 have been published, while the
third is currently finalized:
- [Release 1](/aas/1/0/README.md) from 2018 [1]
- [Release 2](/aas/2/0/README.md) from 2019 [2]
- [Revision 2.0.1](/aas/2/0/1/README.md) from May 2020 [3]
- [Version 3.0](./3/0/README.md) 2020 [4]

Part 2 (Application Programming Interfaces) is available in the sub-namespace [API](./API/).
