# Inspection Documents of Steel Products

This submodel template aims to standardize the representation and storage of inspection data for steel products within the steel manufacturing and supply industry, specifically adhering to the DIN EN 10204:2004 and DIN EN 10168:2004 standards. DIN EN 10204:2004 defines the various types of inspection documents supplied to the customer, while DIN EN 10168:2004 specifies the required document contents for inspection documents of metallic products. 
This template is designed for stakeholders such as steel manufacturers, suppliers, and customers, to facilitate seamless exchange and direct usability of inspection data. It covers the entire lifecycle of steel products from production to delivery, ensuring consistency and reliability in data handling.
The submodel will manage comprehensive inspection documents, including detailed information about the manufacturer and customer, order data, product specifications, mechanical test results, chemical analysis, and validation information. By providing a uniform structure for data related to steel product inspections, this submodel enhances traceability, data interoperability, and compliance across the supply chain, ensuring added value and efficiency for both suppliers and customers.
