# ZVEI Nameplate Version 0 Revision 1

## Introduction

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information. The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of submodels in such manner that information about assets and their nameplate can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It primarily targets process industry but is also suitable for equipments in factory automation by defining standardized meta data. 
In order to ensure a standardized attribute structure within a digital nameplate and hence enable the interoperability of digital nameplates from different manufacturers, one concept for submodel:
#### Nameplate 
is introduced in this submodel template.
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective submodel. The conception is based on existing norms, directives and standards so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved. 
Beside standardized submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling partial aspects within submodels. The standardized SMCs include address and asset product marking.
