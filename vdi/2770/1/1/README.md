# VDI 2770 Paper 1 (Version 1.1)

This sub-namespace collects the first revision of identifiers defined in the VDI specification 2770 Paper 1.

## Introduction

The VDI2770-1 standardizes the documentation in regard to their metadata, classification and format. The idea is that manufacturer handover their documentation in this standardized manner, so that it gets easier for the operator to load the documentation for a component or a complete machine (asset) into their IT infrastructure and, subsequently, that is gets easier to find relevant documents during the operation phase of an asset. The central concepts of the specification are the entities of Document and DocumentVersion, that are described in an UML and XML specification.

## Change Log
This revision changes the following:
* [https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/ManufacturerDocumentation](https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/ManufacturerDocumentation) to [https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/1/Documentation](https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/1/Documentation)


## Status: `submitted`
See the Submodel Template 'Minimum requirements for the Handover documentation from the manufacturer to the operator based on the VDI 2770 specification'.



## ManufacturerDocumentation (Submodel Template)

[https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/1/Documentation](https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/1/Documentation) is the Submodel defining a set of manufacturer documentation to bring about information from manufacturer to operator of industrial equipment.
